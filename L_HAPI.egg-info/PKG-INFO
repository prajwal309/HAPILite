Description: HAPILite is a lighter version of hapi. It contains different function that are scraped from the original hapi, and is meant to remove the functionalities that are usually not required for exo-planetary retrieval at this point. This set of code will focus on propagating the errors during the cross-section generation and its effect on the atmospheric retrieval.
