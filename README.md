HAPILite is a lighter version of hapi. It contains different function that are scraped from the original hapi, and is meant to remove the functionalities that are usually not required for exo-planetary retrieval at this point. This set of code will focus on propagating the errors during the cross-section generation and its effect on the atmospheric retrieval.

TO DO LIST
-------------------
  1. Add multiprocessing flag and capability
  2. Add errors and ways to calculate the sigma values corresponding to the absorption coefficient
  3. Add the effect of diluent such as Hydrogen and Helium
