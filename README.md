HAPILite is a lighter version of hapi. It contains different function that are scraped from the original hapi, and is meant to remove the functionalities that are usually not required for exo-planetary retrieval such as those related to the air broadening or isotopic abundances. This set of code will focus on propagating the errors during the cross-section generation and its effect on the atmospheric retrieval.

TO DO LIST
-------------------
  1. Add errors and ways to calculate the sigma values corresponding to the absorption coefficient
  2. Add the effect of diluent such as Hydrogen and Helium effects on the broadening
  3. Write a wrapper to generate cross-section for a range of temperature and pressure.
